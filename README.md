# Auto-AC-Control
This Arduino Script regulates the Temperature, Cooling and Heating setting by Daylight or night. It switches between turbo cool, cool dry, switch off, heat and fan speed according to the humidity and temperature. 

It uses a heltec esp because i wanted to add a server to it as well to read the sensors and get the A/CStatus, but I did not get around it jet. 
Since one year my two units work flawlessly. They are easy build and little programming skills are needed. 

Parts: 1 heltec esp, 
1 DHT11
1 IR transmitter 
1 Lightdepending resistor board
1 5V regular Celular charger as a power supply
